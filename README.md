# Satellite Orbit Optimization Simulator

The Satellite Orbit Optimization Simulator is a tool designed to calculate and simulate optimal satellite orbits for specific mission parameters. This project leverages Keplerian elements (Eccentricity, Semi-major Axis, Inclination, Longitude of the Ascending Node, and Argument of Periapsis), which can either be entered manually or automatically generated using the tool's "Use AI" function. These elements are then used to create an interactive 3D model, allowing users to visualize satellite orbits around Earth.

Technologies Used --->
The simulator is built using Python and several powerful modules, including:
PySide6         : To create and manage the user interface. (Not included in the GitHub version due to max file capacity errors)
PyGame & OpenGL : For rendering and displaying the interactive 3D simulation.
OpenAI          : To automatically gather Keplerian elements using the latest data available online.

Key Features --->
Interactive 3D Visualization    : Visualize satellite orbits in real time with a user-friendly interface.
AI-Powered Parameter Generation : Automatically retrieve Keplerian elements using OpenAIâ€™s advanced tools.
Customizable Inputs             : Enter mission parameters manually for precise calculations and simulations.

Purpose --->
Built with a focus on aerospace applications, the simulator combines advanced mathematical modeling with real-time data visualization, making it a valuable resource for understanding satellite dynamics and mission planning. The Satellite Orbit Optimization Simulator was developed as a showcase of both aerospace engineering knowledge and software development expertise. It aims to provide an accessible yet powerful tool for visualizing and optimizing satellite missions.
